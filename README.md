 Code from the paper "Marine Spatial Management in the Face of Variable Larval Dispersal", co-authored by Michael Bode

 I must apologise for my unprofessionalism here -- I didn't ever think that my code would be viewed by anyone other than myself, so there will be swear words throughout my code. I must apologise for this, as going through 100+ files and ctr+f ing all the obscenities would be too time consuming.
